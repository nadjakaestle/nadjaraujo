### **About me** <h3>
_____________________________________________________________________________
 
 I'm passionate about technology since I was a child, so I decide to graduate in Computer Science from the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) and acquired proficiency in Software Development with C ++, Python, JavaScript  and others programming languages. I am fascinated by the interface creation area, because I believe that with a good interface is possible to solve the problems of all people around the world. I aim to be a professional UI/UX design YEAH! ♥
